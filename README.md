9. Over the past few years, the percentage of students who leave Lakeland College at the end of the first year has increased. Last year, Lakeland started a voluntary one-week orientation program to help first-year students adjust to campus life. If Lakeland is able to show that the orientation program has a positive effect on retention, they will consider making the program a requirement for all first-year students. Lakeland‚Äôs administration also suspects that students with lower GPAs have a higher probability of leaving Lakeland at the end of the first year. In order to investigate the relation of these variables to retention, Lakeland selected a random sample of 100 students from last year‚Äôs entering class. The data are contained in the file named Lakeland.csv.
The dependent variable ùë¶ = Return was coded as 1 if the student returned to Lakeland for the sophomore year, and 0 if not. The two independent variables are:
‚Ä¢ ùë•1= GPA at the end of the first semester.
‚Ä¢ ùë•2= 0 if the student did not attend the orientation program, or 1 if the student attended the orientation program.
a. Write the logistic regression equation relating ùë•1and ùë•2 to ùë¶.
b. What is the interpretation of ùê∏(ùë¶) when ùë•2=0?
